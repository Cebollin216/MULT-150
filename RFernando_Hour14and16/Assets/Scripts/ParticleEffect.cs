    ParticleEffect.cs

    Particle system settings I modified for Hour 16:

    - Start Color: changed to a neon blue/purple gradient to match the Midnight Drift theme.
    - Start Size: increased so the particles appear larger and more noticeable.
    - Start Lifetime: adjusted so particles stay on screen longer before fading out.
    - Emission Rate over Time: increased to create a denser, more intense effect.
    - Shape: changed from Cone to Sphere so particles spawn in all directions.
    - Gravity Modifier: set slightly negative so particles float upward instead of falling.
