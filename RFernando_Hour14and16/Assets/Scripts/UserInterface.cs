    UserInterface.cs

    UI changes for my Midnight Drift menu:

    - Added a custom neon race car background image (not from the Hour 14 files).
    - Set up a full-screen BackgroundImage inside the Canvas.
    - Adjusted the panel to a semi-transparent dark color so the text is readable.
    - Changed the title text to "Midnight Drift" with a pink color and larger font size.
    - Updated the subtitle text to "Press Start To Play" to give the player instructions.
    - Modified the Start Game button colors (normal, highlighted, and pressed) to match the neon theme.
    - Centered the title, button, and subtitle so the layout feels like a real game start screen.
